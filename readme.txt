Upgrade Information from BMLT Meeting List Generator (original)

Follow all these steps, keep in mind that once you start using bread, it's not going to be easy to back to the original plugin.

1. Ensure that bread is de-activated.
2. Go to your existing "Meeting List", and export the configuration.  (This is in-case something goes bad and you need to undo something).
3. If you have a multi-site installation, be sure to export each one of the configurations within your Network.
4. De-activate the BMLT Meeting List Generator plugin from your site or network (for multisites).
5. Activate bread.  Bread is intended to be fully compatible with BMLT meeting list generator settings.
6. If there is an issue, you can always de-activate bread and go back to the original plugin.
7. You can always restore any files if something got damaged or corrupted assuming that you followed steps 2 & 3.
